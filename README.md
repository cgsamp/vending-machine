PROJECT STRUCTURE
====
This project is based on the Maven archetype quickstart. While it is a simple application, it is important to follow a known framework for dependency management, building, packaging, testing and deployment. 

DEPENDENCIES
====

java 1.8
maven 3.3.3

pom.xml describes other dependencies

RUNNING PROJECT
=====
On any machine with maven installed, clone the git repository, then run
mvn test
to execute the test cases and exercise the applications.

Deploying the application is left as a future exercise; all execution happens in the test suite.

Alternatively, the project can be executed using other command-line tools or IDE as long as the appropriate paths and dependencies are satisfied.
